#Build a fun Number Guessing Game in Python! 🐍 The program picks a random number between 1-100, and you have 7 attempts to guess it. Get hints if you’re too high 📈 or too low 📉! Perfect for practicing loops 🔄, conditionals ❓, and user input ⌨️.


import random

def number_guessing_game():
    random_number = random.randint(1, 100)
    max_attempts = 7

    print("Welcome to the Number Guessing Game")
    print("Guess a number between 1 and 100.")
    print(f"You have {max_attempts} attempts\n")

    for attempt in range(1, max_attempts + 1):
        guess = int(input(f"Attempt {attempt}: Enter your guess: "))

        if guess < random_number:
            print("Too low\n")
        elif guess > random_number:
            print("Too high\n")
        else:
            print(f"You guessed the number {random_number} correctly in {attempt} attempts")
            break
    else:
        print(f"You used all {max_attempts} attempts. The correct number was {random_number}.")
